Build bot for Go

GET /build

It expects a request to /build/package with a request entity
that's a tar file containing the src directory of a Go workspace.
(For convenient use with curl, method PUT is also accepted.)

To build package foo/bar, you could do:

    $ cd $GOPATH
    $ tar cf x.tar --exclude .git src
    $ curl -O -T x.tar http://example.org/build/foo/bar

The build bot uses go get to fetch missing dependencies (but hg
and bzr are not yet available); to fix the version of any
dependencies, provide source code in the tarball you send.

GET /info

You can also request /info to see the output of go version and
go tool dist env.
